      <h1>How to Cut Copper Pipe (with a pipe cutter)</h1>

      <p>
        Working with copper pipe is one of the ultimate apartment diy materials. It’s relatively inexpensive, looks awesome and is simple to work with. Limited tooling is needed to cut copper pipe. In fact, all you need is one nifty and inexpensive tool.

        Copper pipe comes in many different widths but 1/2" type M is definitely my go to. In this little tutorial we’ll go over how to get great straight cuts every time.

      <h4>Parts List</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://amzn.to/2xytDxe">pipe cutter</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://amzn.to/2yXMWkv">1/2" copper pipe</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        * For the pipe cutter - I would highly recommend one with a longer handle like this <a href="http://amzn.to/2xytDxe" target="_blank">one</a>. I started with a mini one and after a few projects, my hand was paying the price.

        We'll start off by marking our cut. I like to use a regular pen, it makes a nice skinny line and rubs off after the cut is made. Then we'll want to line up the cutting wheel with our freshly marked line. Go ahead and begin tightening the pipe cutter until it is nice a snug. No need to really crank it. *Make sure the pipe is centered in your guiding wheels or else it won’t be a straight cut. Begin to spin the cutter around the pipe, tightening up the cutter after about 3 rotations. In a matter of no time the pipe will be cut.

      <p>That's it. Nice and easy with little clean up.</p>
